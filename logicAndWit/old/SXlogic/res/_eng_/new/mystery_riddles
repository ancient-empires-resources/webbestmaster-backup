It is confirmed that one of them is a murderer. The responses of all six people are as given below:

	Max was in the bathroom.

   answer: 'Molly. Explanation:
	Let us suppose that Patrick was not in the second bedroom. This proposes that Jerry, Molly, Max and Mike are liars. It infers that Patrick and Catherine speak truth. But that is not possible as they do not coincide on Mike's location. Therefore, we are wrong with our assumption and Patrick was in the second bedroom. So far, we have established the fact that Patrick was in the second bedroom. Additionally, Patrick and Catherine are liars Now, let us suppose that Jerry speaks truth. This proposes that Max was in the bathroom and Jerry in the second bedroom. This infers that Molly and Max are liars as they told that Jerry was not in the second bedroom. Also it implies that Mike lied, as he said Max was in kitchen. Therefore we have three new liars now, which totals the number of liars to 5, which contradicts the given situation in the question. Hence, now we have established the fact that Jerry is a liar. Let us now suppose that Molly speaks truth. This proposes that Jerry was in the living room and Max was in the Kitchen. This infers that Max and Mike are liars. But again, this is contradicting the situation as we have already established the fact that there are again 5 liars (counting above 3 established liars). Therefore, now we have established that Molly is a liar. Max and Mike speak truth. Catherine was in the bathroom. Jerry was in the first bedroom. Max was in the kitchen. Mike was in second bedroom with Patrick. The killer has to be Molly as no one else was present in the living room.'

   answer: 'We can calculate out how many days there will be for the 13th on each month if we count from the beginning of the year (January 1). Then we divide total days by 7 to get the remainders. We also need to consider the leap year. Through the whole year we had all kinds of remainders, from 0 to 6. The minimum of occurence for all the unique remainders was 1. It means that we have at least one Friday on 13th. In a regular year, the best chance you can get 3 Fridays on 13th, which are in February, March and December because the remainders of these 3 months are 2. In a leap year, the best chance you also can get 3 Fridays on 13th, which are in January, April and July because the remainders of these 3 months are 6.'

Unfortunately they did not know the fact and dropped him on the fir along with the water. He died on the spot.'
