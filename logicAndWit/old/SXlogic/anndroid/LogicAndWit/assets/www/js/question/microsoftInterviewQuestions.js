				title: 'Cheating Husbands Interview Question',
				text: 'There is a town named Panem. The town is well built and have every facility available to the citizens. It comprises of 100 married couples. The husbands of the town are very loyal to their wives but that happens for a reason. There is a rule that is followed by the people of the town. If any wife finds out about her husband\'s infidelity, the husband is immediately executed. No woman in the town talks about their own husband and all they do is gossip about others\'. Thus every woman in the town is familiar with all the other unfaithful husbands but does not know about their own. This can also be explained as that the husbands remain glued lip about their own unfaithfulness. One day, the mayor of the town announces to the people that there is at least one cheating husband in the town. What will happen now?',
				
				answer: 'This one definitely sounds too unusual. But there is an easy way to look at things. Let us say that there is one unfaithful husband in the town. In such a case, 99 women will know about him. The wife of that man will be the only one who will not know about him and would have always thought that his husband is truly faithful to her. But since the mayor announced that there is at least one cheater among them, she will come to a realization that her husband must be cheating on her. So her husband will be executed on the first day of the announcement. Now let us take up a case that there are two cheating husbands in the town. Now 98 women of the town must be knowing about them both. The two wives of those men will think that there is only one cheater in the town. Both of them believes that their respective husbands are loyal and this would not report about them But when both of them will find out on the next day that no one was executed, they will realize that it could only mean that both of their husbands are cheaters. Thus both the husbands will be executed on the second day. Thus if we have X number of cheating husbands, they all will die on the Xth day after the announcement is being made.'

				title: 'Prison Interview Puzzle',
				text: 'Once in a prison with 100 prisoners, the Warden introduces a strange but interesting challenge to all the prisoners. This challenge can even grant them the freedom and thus every one of the prisoners becomes quite excited. The warden selects one prisoner everyday randomly from the lot and moves him into a pitch black room with a bulb and a witch that controls the bulb. The prisoner can carry out three different actions in the room - He can switch on the bulb, switch it off or do nothing and sit idle. A prisoner can be picked up more than one time. Now the warden introduces the twist in the challenge. He tells them that the prisoners can put a stop to the process any day they feel that every one of them has been confined to that room at least once. If the prisoners are correct, then every single one of them will be set free. But if they have put up a wrong judgment, all of them will be killed.  Seeking it to be the only chance of freedom, the prisoners take up the challenge. They are given some time to discuss regarding it before the process could begin. How will they plan things so that they are finally set free?',
				
				answer: 'They select one of the prisoner named Jason to do the trick and frame out a full proof plan. According to their plan, whenever a prisoner other than Jason is selected, they will follows some simple steps - If the bulb is off, they will switch it on but if the bulb is already lit, they won\'t do anything and sit idle. If Jason is selected and he finds out that the bulb is lit, he will add one to his count and will switch off the bulb. If the bulb is already switched off, he will sit there idly. In such a manner when his count reaches to 99, he will tell the warden that every prisoner has now been to the room. Let us craft out the solution in simpler terms. Whenever a prisoner goes inside the room, he simply switches on the bulb if it is off. Thus one prisoner will only light the bulb once. When Jason finds out that the bulb it on, he will know that this has been done by a new prisoner and he will add one to his count. He will keep doing this till his count reaches 99. 99 because, he already has been in the room which makes a total of 100. Thus it is a full proof plan that will definitely set them all free. '

				text: 'There is an equilateral triangle and three bugs are sitting on the three corners of the triangle. Each of the bugs picks up a random direction and starts walking along the edge of the equilateral triangle. What is the probability that none of the bugs crash into each other?',
				
				answer: 'If you have come up with the fact that the bugs can avoid the collision only when they decide to move in the same direction be it clockwise or anti clockwise, you have already solved half of it. In any other way, the bugs will definitely run into each other.  Now the bugs can move either clockwise or anti-clockwise. The probability of choosing a specific direction is then 1/2.  We will utilize the simple equation of probability to find out our answer.<br>P(No Collision) = P (The bugs move in clockwise direction) + P(The bugs move in anti-clockwise direction)<br>= 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5<br>= 0.25<br>Thus the probability that the bugs won\'t collide into each other is 0.25 or 1/4.'

If you are only able to make two breaks in the gold bar, how will you pay the servant if the servant works for the equal time every day and thus equal amount must be paid at the end of the day?',
				
				answer: 'If you are thinking of how to cut in such a way that you are able to make seven equal pieces, you are thinking in the wrong direction. You should give more stress on how to make the transaction with the worker.<br>You have to break the gold bar two times so you have the following sizes of the bar:<br>1/7 ---- Bar A<br>2/7 ---- Bar B<br>4/7 ---- Bar C<br>When the day 1 ends:<br>Give Bar A (You remain with Bar B and Bar C; Worker possess - Bar A)<br>When the day 2 ends:<br>Give Bar B and take the Bar A back (You remain with Bar A and Bar C; Worker possess - Bar B)<br>When the day 3 ends:<br>Give Bar A (You remain with Bar C; Worker possess - Bar A and Bar B)<br>When the day 4 ends:<br>Give Bar C and take back Bar A and Bar B (You remain with Bar A and Bar B; Worker possess - Bar C)<br>When the day 5 ends:<br>Give Bar A (You remain with Bar B; Worker possess - Bar A and Bar C)<br>When the day 6 ends:<br>Give Bar B and take back Bar A (You remain with Bar A; Worker possess - Bar B and Bar C)<br>When the day 7 ends:<br>Give Bar A (You remain with no bar; Worker possess - Bar A, Bar B and Bar C)<br>Thus by the end of seven days, you have taken care of everything.'

Now among the boxes, one of the box comprises of defective balls with each defective ball weighing 9 grams. You have been provided with an electronic weighing machine but you are allowed to use it only once. Can you find out which box contains defective balls?',
				
				answer: 'The question can practically disarm you. But we promise by the time you read the solution, you will find that it was way easy than you were thinking. Let us name the boxes with a number - Box1, Box 2..., Box10. Now you must be familiar with the weights of the balls precisely. By saying that we are not implying that you will have to take one ball from every box and judge the weight of every ball.  What you have to do is pick one ball from Box 1, 2 balls from Box 2, 3 balls from Box 3, ...., 10 balls from Box 10. Thus after taking balls from every box in such a manner, you will finally have 55 balls in total. There comes the time to use the weighing machine. If all the balls were weighing adequate, the combined weight should be 55 x 10 grams = 550 grams. But since one of the box has defected balls, the weight will be less than that. Here is the tricky part and explains why we took different number of balls from each box.  If the total weight is less than 1 gram, then the defective box is the Box 1 since we took 1 ball from that box. If the Box 2 is defective, the total weight will be less than 2 grams. In similar fashion you can identify the defective box by analyzing the total weight that is calculated by the weighing machine.'

				title: 'Walking on Globe Interview Puzzle',
				text: 'If you walk one mile south, then one mile east and then one mile north, you reach the place where you started. In such a scenario, how many points are there on the globe to make it happen?',
				
				answer: 'Did you consider the southern hemisphere? If you did you must be knowing that there is a ring near the South Pole with a circumference of one mile. Consider the situation that you are standing on one mile north of the ring at any point. Now if you walk on the southern direction and cover one mile, you will be standing on the ring. Traveling one mile east will bring you on the circumference of the ring. Walking one mile north from there, you will be standing on the exact point where you started. Now if you start counting, you will understand that while you walk 1 mile north in the end, you can reach an infinite number of points. In such a case, the total number of possible points possible are 1 + infinite. Now let us consider the ring that is half a mile in circumference near the South Pole. If you walk a mile along the ring, you would circle twice but will reach the point where you started from. In such a case if you start from the point that is located one mile north of a half mile ring, it will also help you reach the starting point after traveling as per asked. Now with every possible integer N, there is a circle with radius R = 1 / 2 (2*pi*n); which is centered at the South Pole. If you walk along these rings, you will be circling N times and again returning to the point where you started. You must note that the possible values for N are infinite. Also, you can have infinite ways of selecting a starting point which is located one mile north of the rings which means that there are (infinite * infinite) possible points. Concluding with our statements, the possible number of points are equal to 1 + infinite * infinite which is equal to infinite.<br>Thus there are infinite points possible. '

And then if it does not breaks, we will continue in the following fashion<br>8, (8+7), (8+7+6), (8+7+6+5), (8+7+6+5+4), (8+7+6+5+4+3), (8+7+6+5+4+3+2), (8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1) = 8, 15, 21, 26, 30, 33, 35, 36<br>Suppose if the egg breaks from 20th floor<br>It will not break from eights<br>It will not break from fifteenth<br>It will break from twenty first<br>You will still have one egg remaining<br>Now start putting from sixteenth floor moving up one floor every time<br>It will not break till nineteenth and it will break of twentieth floor.<br>For the worst scenario possible, the maximum number of droppings will be eight only.'

				text: 'If you walk one mile south, then one mile east and then one mile north, you reach the place where you started. In such a scenario, how many points are there on the globe to make it happen?',
				
				answer: 'Did you consider the southern hemisphere? If you did you must be knowing that there is a ring near the South Pole with a circumference of one mile. Consider the situation that you are standing on one mile north of the ring at any point. Now if you walk on the southern direction and cover one mile, you will be standing on the ring. Traveling one mile east will bring you on the circumference of the ring. Walking one mile north from there, you will be standing on the exact point where you started. Now if you start counting, you will understand that while you walk 1 mile north in the end, you can reach an infinite number of points. In such a case, the total number of possible points possible are 1 + infinite. Now let us consider the ring that is half a mile in circumference near the South Pole. If you walk a mile along the ring, you would circle twice but will reach the point where you started from. In such a case if you start from the point that is located one mile north of a half mile ring, it will also help you reach the starting point after traveling as per asked. Now with every possible integer N, there is a circle with radius R = 1 / 2 (2*pi*n); which is centered at the South Pole. If you walk along these rings, you will be circling N times and again returning to the point where you started. You must note that the possible values for N are infinite. Also, you can have infinite ways of selecting a starting point which is located one mile north of the rings which means that there are (infinite * infinite) possible points. Concluding with our statements, the possible number of points are equal to 1 + infinite * infinite which is equal to infinite.<br>Thus there are infinite points possible. '
