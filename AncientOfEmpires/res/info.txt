Welcome to another guide of a splendid mobile game! If you look for ratings
of the game you'l probably see none below 8! This game is kinda Advance Wars
remade for a java mobile device. Mobile Wars :). Pretty good game and it's
worth the 4 euros (about 5 USD) that the game costs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you need to do to play Ancient Empires is to get hold of the
game. Download it to a compatible phone from your local service provider.
Once downloaded, the game is in the 'games' section of your mobile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Game Modes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ancient Empires can be played in two modes - story mode and skirmish mode.

   Story mode

This mode puts you in the boots of King Galamar at the outskirts of his
kingdom, where you must guide your loyal blue guards to secure new allies and
fight increasingly difficult battles. Your enemy is the dreaded red legion led
by your treacherous twin brother, Valadorn. The story mode also contains
helpful hints on how to play the game and control the troops.

   Skirmish mode

This mode lets you practice your skills by fighting a custom battle either by
yourself or against a friend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Controls
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ancient Empires has a 'point and click' interface.

- 2, 4, 6, 8 move the cursor
- 5 selects a unit, menu item or destination
- 7 shows unit or terrain details


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Movement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select and move units by pressing 5 and then pressing 5 again on the selected
destination square. A unit can move and attack once per turn.
The flashing white border marks the movement range of a unit. A unit's range
is determined by its type and the terrain it is on.

Different types of terrain affect a unit's ability to move, attack and defend.
For example, mountains add defence points but slow units down. When you move
the cursor these terrain features appear at the bottom of the screen.

When a unit has completed a move, an 'E' appears next to it. This means that
it cannot be used again until your next turn. You can move each unit only once
each turn. When you have finished moving your units bring up the menu and
choose 'end turn'.

You can view the attack range of any unit by pressing '0' when it is selected.
To attack an enemy unit, move your unit within range and select 'attack'.
If there is more than one enemy in range, select which unit to attack.
The success of your attack is determined by unit characteristics and terrain.

Occupying buildings and purchasing new units
Only a king can occupy a castle. When stationed in a castle, the king can
purchase new units with gold.

You can earn gold by occupying buildings. This is done by moving a soldier
onto it and selecting 'occupy'. Once a building is occupied, it changes colour
Once a building has been occupied, it earns gold. The more buildings you
occupy, the more you earn.

Units can also be healed by stationing them in an occupied building.
The longer a unit stays, the more life it regains.

Type      Att.  Def.  Mov.   Cost   Description

Soldier   5     1     4      150G   Hardworking and brave, soldiers form the
                                    backbone of any army. They are also the
                                    only unit that can capture towns to earn
                                    gold.

Archer    5     1     4      250G   With their powerful bows archers can
                                    attack from a distance and are especially
                                    powerful against airborne enemies.

Lizard    5     0+2   3+3    300G   Descendants of the ancient amphibian
                                    empire spanning the marshlands in the east
                                    Lizards are proud warriors. They are
                                    immensely mobile (+3) and stronger in
                                    defence (+2) when in water.

Wizard    4     1     4      400G   The ancient guild of wizards are weak at
                                    close combat, but immensely useful as they
                                    can summon fighting skeletons from dead
                                    troops.

Wisp      3     2     4      500G   These mystical beings of pure light
                                    radiate an aura which adds attack points
                                    to nearby friendly units. In close combat
                                    they are especially deadly against
                                    skeletons.

Эти мифические существа из чистого света излучают ауру, которая добавляет очков атаки дружественным юнитам. В ближнем бою они особенно смертельны против скелетов.

Spider    6     2     5      600G   Spiders are dangerous creatures whose
                                    natural habitat spans the unforgiving dark
                                    forests of the west. In addition to being
                                    highly mobile, spiders use a poisoned
                                    attack to weaken their opponents for one
                                    turn.

Skeleton  5     1     4             Summoned by Wizards, these lifeless
                                    warriors are as strong as soldiers and
                                    deadly opponents on any battlefield.

Golem     6     4     4             Forged out of living rock by the dwarf
                                    tribes of the Lost Mountains, Golems are
                                    slow but immensely strong in defence.
                                    A golem stationed in a building or a
                                    well defended mountain is very difficult
                                    to defeat.

Catapult  7     2     3             Catapults bring devastation wherever they
                                    go with their enormous attack range.
                                    However, their relative immobility and
                                    inability to attack up close make them
                                    vulnerable so guard them well. Catapults
                                    can either move or attack during a turn,
                                    but not do both.

Wyvern    8     3      7            These majestic flying beasts have ruled
                                    over the mountains of mist since ancient
                                    times. They are extremely mobile as well
                                    as deadly in attack on land, air and sea.

King      5     3      4            The heartbeat of the army, a King is very
                                    strong in attack and defence. Kings do
                                    usually not take part in battles, as they
                                    are the only units capable to buy new
                                    troops when stationed in a castle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Use the terrain
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Different terrain types offer different degree of protection against enemy
attacks. Always station your units on terrain that offers the maximum
protection, such as hills or villages. Avoid attacking units which are well
protected by the terrain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Save often
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save the game after every few turns to ensure that you can easily load the
saved game if you realise you made a mistake. You can save the game at any
time by pressing the left soft key and choosing "save" from the menu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Conquer and protect your villages
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gold is the life blood of your army. Ultimately if you control more villages
than your enemy, you will be able to produce more troops and win the battle
more easily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Keep your units alive
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dead units can't fight battles, so it is best not to get into battles that you
will not win. Remember that you can heal your units by moving them onto
occupied villages - where the will gain hit points every turn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Using Wisps
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite being slow and relatively weak in attack, wisps grant formidable
attack and defence bonuses to nearby units through the aura that they emit.
Use them to fortify your troops, and destroy them first in enemy formations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Using Catapults
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While being deadly at a very long range, catapults are vulnerable up close.
When an enemy catapult is terrorizing your units, use highly mobile units such
as spiders, skeletons or wyverns to attack the catapults. When it is your
catapult that is wrecking havoc with the enemy, remember to protect it well.
Remember also that a catapult can only ever either move or attack during a
turn, never do both.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Using Wyverns
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wyverns are extremely mobile and strong in attack and defence. They are,
however, vulnerable against archers and other wyverns. Wyverns are best slain
by using a combination of archers, wyverns and a catapult. Wyverns are best
protected by keeping them out of range of enemy archer attacks.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The kingdom of Thorn is divided. Betrayed by his own twin brother Valadorn.
King Galamarhas fled into the borderlands of the east. Only the Blue guard,
Galamar's personal troops, have remained loyal and stand ready to reclaim the
land...

Your soldiers are tired of the battle they fought last night, get to the
abandoned castle to the south east.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             MISSION 1 - REGROUP

         King Galamar must occupy castle, keep 75% of troops alive.

         Your troops         King, Soldier (2), Archer
        Enemy troops         Soldier (2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well nothing you can do at the moment, this is the tutorial, no enemies are
located on the map. Just head to the castle with the king. Oh wait, as soon as
you try to cross the bridge two soldiers of the Red Legion appear. Make sure
the king doesn't die, and kill the stupid guys! The first soldier will proably
be killed as the Red Legion can attack first, the battle system is similar to
Advance wars, one soldier unit exists of 10 soldiers, based on their attack
some of the other unit's troops will be killed too. Also be careful because
the enemy can cross the river not only the bridge. Put your soldier in the
front row along with your king, the archer should be in the second one.
Don't worry about the King, he's got enough defense. The only thing left to do
is lead the king into the castle and select occupy.

                               MISSION COMPLETE

Well, this one battle isn't enough to get back Galamar's kingdom, well duh!
Else the game would be a little too short. Your forces are going to a village
to have a rest but, as suspected, Red Legion forces show up to make some
trouble!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             MISSION 2 - FRIENDS AND ENEMIES

    Occupy the castle and villages, produce at least one new unit of troops.

         Your troops         King, Soldier (2), Archer, Lizard (2)
        Enemy troops         Spider (3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A reminder for that you occupied a building already is that it changes color.
First, let's move your force east, occupy the first two buildings.
Occupied buildings give gold so the King can buy new recruits and have the
ability to heal soldiers. Oh this game is sooooo Advance Wars-like!

Continue by capturing the 3 remaining buildings on the map, when you've done
that, two lizards will come out of the castle and inform you that spiders are
attacking their forces in the woods to the left. On your battlefield three
will appear. Don't rush to them, but attack them in a group as they have a
high attack, and they could kill you easily. Keep the king on the castle, and
use the money from the buildings you've captured to create some new units.
It's recommend you buy lizards as they can form a wall on the water for your
archer and soldiers who can attack them from above and below.

                               MISSION COMPLETE

Now the lizards are on our side let's head to the wizards of the Grey Tower.
As soon as you head west the bridge collapses, it's a trap of that creep
Valadorn! Find another way!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             MISSION 3 - ESCORT THE LIZARD CHIEF

               Galamar and the lizard chief must reach the Grey Tower.

         Your troops         King, Soldier (2), Archer, Lizard Chief
        Enemy troops         Spider, Wizard, Archer, Soldier (2), Skeleton
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're outnumbered! quickly head north but form a group in the middle,
the enemies will come down, and the spider from the left will come over the
water. Use your lizard to attack from the water. The soldiers on land and the
archer in the second row. When the enemies from the north are dead, wait for
the spider to reach your troops. Because those are on the water their movement
is limited, wait for them to be in range and attack them with all your forces.
Now head left and defeat the wizard. Occupy the tower with the King to win
this battle.

                               MISSION COMPLETE

Maybe your soldiers thought they could rest for a while in the grey tower but
nope, a messenger told the King there is an suprise attack on
the city of Var Telan. So prepare for another battle.

                             MISSION 4 - REINFORCEMENTS

                      Save the city: destroy all enemy units!

         Your troops         King, Soldier , Archer, Lizard, Wizard, Wisp
        Enemy troops         Catapult, Spider, Wisp, Soldier, Archer, Wizard
                             Golem, Valadorn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, use your soldier to occupy the nearby building. There are several
things you can do now, I waited for the enemy troops to come to me and attack
them with all my forces while the king bought new units. But you have to
be careful of the catapult, it's really a pain in the ass. And to make it
even worse, the King's evil brother shows up, yes! He turned the city against
you and is ready to defeat you once and for all! Now you have a wizard you
don't have to fear dead of your troops because they can raise them into
skeletons which are much stronger than your current troops. But on the other
hand you should hurry because Valadorn can also buy units! Make an army and
capture as much buildings as you can so Valadorn doesn't get money from them
anymore. Defeat Valadorn and you will win the battle.

The kingdom of Thorn is divided. Betrayed by his own twin brother Valadorn.
King Galamar has fled into the borderlands of the east. Only the Blue guard,
Galamar's personal troops, have remained loyal and stand ready to reclaim the
land...

Sire, your troops are weary after last night's battle. It would be wise to
regroup at the abandoned castle.

Sound advice, captain. Ready the troops - we should not let the enemy catch us
unprepared.

Valadorn's army should be easy to spot with their red uniforms.

His Red legion must know where we are! Quickly, protect the king!

King Galamar has survived Valadorn's attack. However, before Galamar can try
to reclaim his kingdom he must firt strengthen his forces. TO the north a
village where his troops can rest, and perhaps find some new recruits.

Forward, troops. We can rest once we reach the village.

A scout of the Lizard people of the north are under attack

Then we must act quickly! The lizard chief is an old ally, and he will be sure
to help us if we can save him.

Sire, these lizards bring news from their village. They are under attack from
forest spiders!

Spiders? Then we will have to use the terrain to our  advantage - rushing to
attack would be foolish.

Be careful your majesty - the spiders attack is poisonous!

Lizards are amphibious, giving them increased movement and defence when in
water.

A spider attack is poisonous. A poisoned unit is slow and weak for its next
turn.

The lizard chief agrees to join Galamar's forces. Now Galamar's thoughts turn
to the wizards of the Grey Tower. If the lizard chief can persuade them to
help, their magic would be a great asset to his growing forces.

Sire, the bridge has been destroyed!

Valadorn must be expecting us - we must find another way across. This could be
a trap.

Troops! Keep your eyes open and protect the lizard chief at all cost.

Having reached the Grey Tower, the High Wizard agres to help Galamar.
However, Galamar's troops have no time to rest, as a message arrives from the
nearby city of Var Telan, telling of a suprise attack by Valadorn's Red Legion

Your majesty, the Red legion are approaching from the South: we had better
move quickly!

What is this treachery! The city has turned against us!

Ha ha ha! As predictable as ever, brother! I have you now!
